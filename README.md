# Pinterest Visualizer

This is a Sveltekit web application designed to scrape data from Pinterest boards and visualize the results in a meaningful way.

The application uses the `image-js` and `resemblejs` libraries for image processing and comparison.

To run the application locally, use the `dev` script defined in the [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22package.json%22%5D 'package.json') file:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

To build the application for production, use the `build` script:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Please note that you need to set up the necessary environment variables in a [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.env%22%5D '.env') file based on the provided [`.env.example`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.env.example%22%5D '.env.example') file.

This application is still in development (version 0.0.1) and contributions are welcome.
